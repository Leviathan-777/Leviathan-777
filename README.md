### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science graduate with a diverse range of hobbies and a strong academic background. Iâ€™m specializing in AI and Machine Learning; I bring a deep understanding of computer science principles and a keen interest in developing intelligent systems. When I'm not coding, you can often find me playing the piano, exploring new music, hiking in nature, or diving into the pages of books. I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions in the world of technology.
