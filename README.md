### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science graduate specializing in AI and Machine Learning. Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python and C as well as gained knowledge about software engineering, embedded systems, IoT, database management and machine learning. I have completed several individual and group projects where I have demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively, effectively communicate ideas, developed an understanding of good coding practices, and learnt about methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall. I gained expertise in Java during my 12 months of software engineering internship. My primary interest is developing Machine Learning and AI technologies. When I'm not coding, you can often find me playing the piano, exploring new music, hiking in nature, or diving into the pages of books. I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions in the world of technology.
