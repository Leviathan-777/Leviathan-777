### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science graduate with one year of experience as a software engineer. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from web development and mobile app design to machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, C/C++ and Java, as well as gained knowledge about web development, machine learning, software engineering, embedded systems and database management. I have completed several individual and group projects where demonstrated the ability to work collaboratively and effectively communicate ideas. Due to University projects and the internship, I developed an understanding of good coding practices and methodologies such as Agile and Scrum. I also gained expertise in Java and UNIX systems during a software engineering internship at IBM. I'm committed to learning about new technologies and constantly developing new skills. When I'm not coding, you can often find me playing the piano, exploring new music, hiking in nature, learning new things about cars, or diving into the pages of books. I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions in the world of technology.
