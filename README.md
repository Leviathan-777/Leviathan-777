### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science graduate specializing in AI and Machine Learning. Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python as well as gained knowledge about web development, software engineering, database management, and machine learning. I have completed several individual and group projects where I have demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively, effectively communicate ideas, developed understanding of good coding practices and learnt how to follow methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall. I gained expertise in Java during my 12 months of software engineering internship. When I'm not coding, you can often find me playing the piano, exploring new music, hiking in nature, or diving into the pages of books. I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions in the world of technology.
